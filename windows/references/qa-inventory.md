## User-visible claims

1. The home screen visibly matches the reference mood: one cropped pink-purple starry hero, Fiona portrait crop, signature/brand treatment, native Codex suggestion cards, polaroid, and skinned native composer.
2. The sidebar is blush glass rather than merely changing the accent color.
3. All real Codex controls remain interactive; the skin is not a screenshot overlay.
4. The skin survives route changes and renderer reloads while the injector daemon runs.
5. The official Store package and `app.asar` remain unchanged.
6. Restore removes the injected DOM/CSS and install/restore can be repeated.
7. A custom Windows theme image, name, tagline, signature, and accent palette can be saved and applied without editing source files.

## Functional checks

- Home feature card: click one card and confirm the real composer is populated or the normal action occurs.
- Project selector: click the real project chip under the "选择项目" label and confirm the native project menu opens.
- Sidebar: open a real task, then return to New Task.
- Composer: type text, verify caret/readability, then clear it without sending.
- Reload: use CDP `Page.reload`, wait, and confirm the injection marker returns.
- Restore/reapply cycle: remove live skin, verify marker absent, apply again, verify marker present.
- Custom theme cycle: run `set-dream-theme.ps1` with a test image and colors, launch/apply, verify the theme name appears in injector verification output, then reset the theme.
- Update resilience: resolve the current `OpenAI.Codex` Appx location dynamically; never store a versioned WindowsApps path.

## Visual checks

- 1280x820 initial home: hero, four native cards, real project selector, and composer are all visible without horizontal scrolling.
- Narrower window: accept Codex's native responsive reduction to two or three suggestion cards; no essential control is covered and the polaroid may intentionally hide.
- Normal task: messages remain readable and composer does not overlap content.
- Inspect the sidebar, header, hero edges, card labels, composer controls, scrollbar, ribbon, and bottom-right decoration.
- Reject black/transparent sidebar artifacts, clipped cards, duplicated/disconnected project labels, rasterized native controls, weak contrast, or decorations intercepting clicks.

## Exploratory checks

- Start when the debug port is occupied: fail with a clear message or use a caller-selected port.
- Start after Codex updates: package discovery and injection still work without patching installed files.
